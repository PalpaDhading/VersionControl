LESSION TWO:

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It give control for the files you commit and give better perpective , repository and working directory are  more physical and staging area is more vertual . This is the place where git commit takes place .

macpro ((bafc65b...) *) asteroids $ git diff --staged
macpro ((bafc65b...) *) asteroids $ git reset --hard
HEAD is now at bafc65b add delay back to bullets
macpro ((bafc65b...)) asteroids $ git diff
macpro ((bafc65b...)) asteroids $ git status
HEAD detached from 3884eab
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	pappu-pakia/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
macpro ((bafc65b...)) asteroids $ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
macpro ((2c52002...)) versionTest $ git checkout
macpro ((2c52002...)) versionTest $ git status
HEAD detached at 2c52002
nothing to commit, working directory clean
macpro ((2c52002...)) versionTest $ git diff
macpro ((2c52002...)) versionTest $ git diff --staged
macpro ((2c52002...)) versionTest $ 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?  Using >git diff --staged and >git log and >git status 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?  one of the branches will be there untouched and undamaged .

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

 yes

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Mannualy is helps to preserve the work done over time

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
